## Data Sources & Methodology

This project utilizes geospatial data from various government and open-source providers. To maintain a lightweight repository, raw GIS files (Shapefiles, original CSVs) are hosted externally.

| Data Type | Source | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| School Locations | DepEd / Open Data PH | GeoJSON / CSV |
| River Networks | NAMRIA / Humanitarian Data Exchange | Shapefile |
| Regional Boundaries | PSA / GADM | Shapefile |
